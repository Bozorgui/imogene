\description{
Calculates Epithelial Mesenchymal transition (EMT) score
}
\details{
To calculate EMT score, gene expressions in EMT_gene_list are weighted by their sign factor to account for the direction of the effect on EMT (See EMT_gene_list for list of genes and their direction of effect). The EMT_score is defined as  mean value of modified expressions. Scores are then mean-centered and normalized by standard deviation based on distribution of scores in all samples.
