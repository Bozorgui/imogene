\description{
Calculate synergy score for the association effect of two genes/proteins on a feature or response
}
\details{
fdata is a numeric data frame with 3 columns: The first column contains the numeric value of a single feature. The second and third column are any of the numbers 1 or 4, representing low or high levels of expression of two genes/proteins respectely. For details of quantile startification see get_quantile_rank.

Synergy score calculation are based on Bliss defenition of independence: First median values of the feature column are determined for four groups of low-low, low-high, high-low and high-high expressions. Lets define ma, mb, and mc as median of low-high, high-low and high-high groups minus median of low-low group. The synergy score is then defined as
floor(abs(sign(ma) + sign(mb) + sign(mc)) / 3)*(abs(mc) - max(abs(ma) , abs(mb))). The value of the score is positive for synergistic effects and negative for antagonistic effects. By default the synergy score will be zero if ma, mb , and mc have opposite signs.
