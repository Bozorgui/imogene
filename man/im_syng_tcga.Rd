\item{method}{A charachter string indicating which synergy score to be used. one of "max" or "independence". Default is "max".}

\item{add_pvalue}{An optional logical indicating if a random bootstrapping value should be calculated. Default is FALSE.}

\description{
Find combinatorial association of immunotherapy co-targets with tumor intrinsic features as listed in TCGA_immune_features_list.
}
\details{
im_syng_tcga uses expression data from cbioportal data, 2018  tcga pancan atlas to find combinatorial association of immunotherapy co-targets and immune checkpoints with immuno-oncology features as listed in TCGA_immune_features_list

For synergy score calculations all features are normalized to be on \link{0,1} range. For details of synergy score calculations see get_syng_score function.

By default (if no icp_gene is specified), icp_gene_list will be used.

All barcodes in sample_list must be 15 charachter long and belong to the same cohort. When sample_list is provided, cohort should be the disease cohort that they belong to, otherwise only the first element of the cohort list will be used.

The optional data_feature must be normalized to have a range between \link{0,1}.

A p.value is computed using random bootstraping with replacement from the distibution of synergy scores for each immune checkpointand-immune feature pair. The default values of N_iteration is 1000.
