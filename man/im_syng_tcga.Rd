\arguments{
\item{cotarget}{A character vector of gene Hugo symbols.}

\item{cohort}{a list of TCGA diseases}

\item{method}{a charachter string indicating which synergy score to be used. one of "HSA" or "Bliss". Default is HSA.}

\item{add_pvalue}{An optional logical indicating if a random bootstrapping value should be calculated. Default is FALSE.}

\description{
Find combinatorial association of immunotherapy co-targets with all tumor intrinsic features.
}
\details{
im_syng_tcga uses gene expressions from cbioportal data, 2018  tcga pancan atlas to find combinatorial association of immunotherapy co-targets and immune checkpoints with immuno-oncology features as listed in TCGA_immune_features_list

For details of synergy score calculations see get_syng_score function.

By default (if no checkpoint is specified), icp_gene_list will be used.

The optional data_feature must be normalized to have a range between \link{0,1}.

A p.value is computed using random bootstraping with replacement from the distibution of synergy scores for each immune checkpointand-immune feature pair. The default values of N_iteration is 1000.
