\description{
Finds combinatorial association of immunotherapy co-targets with tumor intrinsic features as listed in TCGA_immune_features_list.
}
\details{
im_syng_tcga uses RNASeq2GeneNorm expression data, as provided by \code{\pkg{curatedTCGAData}}, to find combinatorial association of immunotherapy co-targets and immune checkpoints with immuno-oncology features as listed in TCGA_immune_features_list

For synergy score calculations all features are normalized to be on \link{0,1} range. For details of synergy score calculations see get_syng_score function.

By default (if no icp_gene is specified), icp_gene_list will be used.

All barcodes in sample_list must be 15 character long and belong to the same cohort. When sample_list is provided, cohort should be the disease cohort that they belong to, otherwise only the first element of the cohort list will be used.

The optional data_feature must be normalized to have a range between \link{0,1}.

A p.value is computed using random bootstrapping with replacement from the distribution of synergy scores for each immune checkpoint and immune feature pair.

Sensitivity analysis reports a sensitivity index which is a variance in synergy score using 90\% of samples.
